# Frontend Code Challenge â€“ ReactJS

Hi,

Thank you for reviewing my submission. Below is a summary of the three tasks and how to verify each of them.

---

##  Challenge 1: JavaScript Function

- I wrote the solution in a standalone `.js` file.
- You can open the browser console and copy-paste the code to see the result directly.
- The function was tested manually in the browser console and is working as expected.

##  Challenge 2: Currency Swap UI (React + TypeScript + Tailwindcss)

- The full source code has been uploaded.
- I also deployed the app for easier testing:
  
  ðŸ”— [Live Demo](https://honglam1292.github.io/vite-demo-project/)

- The UI is responsive and functional across modern browsers.
- Built using ReactJS + TypeScript + TailwindCSS.

##  Challenge 3: Code Review + Refactor

- I analyzed and listed issues such as inefficient use of `useMemo`, incorrect logic, `any` types, and missing keys...
- I then refactored the code to improve readability, type safety, and performance.
- You can find both the comments and the final version in the file:

  ðŸ“„ `src/components/BalanceList.tsx`
